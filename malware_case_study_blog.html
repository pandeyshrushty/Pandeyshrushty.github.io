    <h1>Malware Detection - Real World Experience</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p>Today I thought of checking my email, and I found some job-related messages. I decided to apply for part-time data entry jobs. As I proceeded, clicking next and next, an application downloaded a file onto my PC. Before opening it, I had a feeling that it might contain a virus or malware. So, I decided to first check it using VirusTotal. I analyzed the URL and found that it was flagged for malware and malicious activity.</p>

        <p>After that, I thought of scanning the downloaded file as well — and it showed 4 detections. I then decided to run further checks. I tried using Any.run, but it asked for a business email, so I quit that. Then, I uploaded the file to Hybrid Analysis (an advanced malware analysis tool), and it also flagged the file as malicious. That confirmed my suspicion — opening this file would not be safe. My instinct and understanding told me it was malicious, and I was able to identify this because I have completed a SOC Analyst Certification.</p>
